FeedWordPress is an Atom/RSS aggregator for WordPress. It syndicates content
from feeds that you choose into your WordPress weblog; the content it syndicates
appears as a series of special posts in your WordPress posts database. If you
syndicate several feeds then you can use WordPress's posts database and
templating engine as the back-end of an aggregation ("planet") website. It was
developed, originally, because I needed a more flexible replacement for
[Planet][] to use at Feminist Blogs, an aggregator site that I used to administer.

FeedWordPress is designed with flexibility, ease of use, and ease of
configuration in mind. You'll need a working installation of WordPress (version
[3.0] or later), and also FTP or SFTP access to your web host. The ability to
create cron jobs on your web host is helpful but not required. You *don't* need
to tweak any plain-text configuration files and you *don't* need shell access
to your web host to make it work. (Although, I should point out, web hosts that
*don't* offer shell access are *bad web hosts*.)

## Installation

To use FeedWordPress, you will need:

* 	an installed and configured copy of [WordPress][] or [WordPress MU][]
	(version 3.0 or later).

*	FTP, SFTP or shell access to your web host

### New Installations

1.	Download the FeedWordPress installation package and extract the files on
	your computer. 

2.	Create a new directory named `feedwordpress` in the `wp-content/plugins`
	directory of your WordPress installation. Use an FTP or SFTP client to
	upload the contents of your FeedWordPress archive to the new directory
	that you just created on your web host.

3.	Log in to the WordPress Dashboard and activate the FeedWordPress plugin.

4.	Once the plugin is activated, a new **Syndication** section should
	appear in your WordPress admin menu. Click here to add new syndicated
	feeds, set up configuration options, and determine how FeedWordPress
	will check for updates. For help, see the [FeedWordPress Quick Start][]
	page.

### Upgrades

To *upgrade* an existing installation of FeedWordPress to the most recent
release:

1.	Download the FeedWordPress installation package and extract the files on
	your computer. 

2.	Upload the new PHP files to `wp-content/plugins/feedwordpress`,
	overwriting any existing FeedWordPress files that are there.
	
3.	Log in to your WordPress administrative interface immediately in order
	to see whether there are any further tasks that you need to perform
	to complete the upgrade.

4.	Enjoy your newer and hotter installation of FeedWordPress
